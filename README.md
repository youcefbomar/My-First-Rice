This is the first rice i ever make so i hope u guys enjoy it , plus i wish for any notes to help me improve on my ricing skills and shit u know the drill man .

So bassically this rice is made on arch linux, I used the tiling window manager hyprland  , i used waybar dot files from another guy here is its git repo :
