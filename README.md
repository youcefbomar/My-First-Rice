# My first ever rice :


This is the first rice i ever make so i hope u guys enjoy it , plus i wish for any notes to help me improve on my ricing skills and shit u know the drill man .

## My goals :

* Make it clean and minimalistic
* Make it run on potatoes and calculators (not literally here)
* Blur

So basically this rice is made on arch linux, I used the tiling window manager hyprland  , i used waybar dot files from another guy here is its git repo : https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles.git
